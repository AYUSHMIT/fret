# Sortable Table Display

In this mode, FRET displays your requirements in a flat, tabular form, as seen below.

You can sort your requirements based on any field represented in the table columns,
i.e., ID, summary, or project (if in _All Projects_ view).

On the right of each requirement id, the plus sign button allows you to create a child requirement. Child requirement forms opened in this fashion have their _parent requirement_ id field automatically filled out.

The top right _list_ button allows you to enter a mode where you can select individual requirements in the table for exporting or other functions.
