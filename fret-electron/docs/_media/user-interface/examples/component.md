#### Component (mandatory)

Specifies the component of the system that the requirement applies to. ID is a string identifier starting with an upper- or lower-case letter, followed by letters, digits or underscores ‘_’

Examples:
* FMS_CMD_INPUT
* fuel_pump_99
* BackupGenerator1

>Single-letter identifiers are strongly discouraged, because they may clash
with reserved keywords of some tools used internally by FRET (e.g., NuSMV).
